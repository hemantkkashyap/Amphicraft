          <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>

          <p>
            At Team Event , we aim to provide a transparent and fair refund and
            cancellation policy to our users. Please read the following
            guidelines carefully regarding refunds and cancellations for event
            registrations:
          </p>

          <h3>Refunds</h3>

          <p>
            Refund requests must be made within 3 or 4 days from the date of
            registration. Refunds are processed back to the original payment
            method used during registration. Processing fees or transaction
            charges may apply, which will be deducted from the refund amount.
            Refunds will not be issued for cancellations made after the
            specified deadline.
          </p>

          <h3>Cancellations</h3>

          <p>
            Users can cancel their event registration by contacting our support
            team at [Your Support Email]. Cancellations made before the deadline
            specified in the event details will be eligible for a full refund.
            Cancellations made after the deadline may not be eligible for a
            refund, except under exceptional circumstances. In case of event
            cancellation by the organizer, registered participants will be
            notified promptly, and refunds will be processed accordingly.
          </p>

          <h3>Exceptions</h3>

          <p>
            Requests for refunds outside of the specified refund window may be
            considered on a case-by-case basis. Refunds for extenuating
            circumstances, such as medical emergencies or unforeseen events, may
            be granted at the discretion of the management team.
          </p>
